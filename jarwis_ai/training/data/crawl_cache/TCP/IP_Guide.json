      "text_content": "Welcome to The TCP/IP Guide!\nSite design by\nJunefire DTP\nView my photos online!\nOverview\nThe TCP/IP Guide is a reference resource on the TCP/IP \n\tprotocol suite that was designed to be not only comprehensive, but \n\tcomprehensible. Organized using a logical, hierarchical structure, The \n\tTCP/IP Guide uses a personal, easy-going writing style that lets anyone \n\tunderstand the technologies that run the Internet. The Guide explains dozens of protocols \n\tand technologies in over 1,500 pages. It includes full coverage of PPP, ARP, \n\tIP, IPv6, IP NAT, IPSec, Mobile IP, ICMP, RIP, BGP, TCP, UDP, DNS, DHCP, \n\tSNMP, FTP, SMTP, NNTP, HTTP, Telnet and much more.\nThe result of over three years' work by the \n\tauthor of the widely acclaimed electronic resource\nThe PC Guide\n,\nThe TCP/IP Guide breaks new ground in technical \n\teducation, combining understandable text with numerous examples, over 300 \n\tfull-color illustrations, and numerous ease-of-use features. It is distributed in electronic (PDF) \n\tform, resulting in numerous benefits: up-to-date content, lower cost, \n\timmediate availability, thousands of hyperlinks between related topics, and \n\tinstant text search. The TCP Guide is ideal for anyone who wants to\nreally\nunderstand how TCP/IP works, including educators, students, networking \n\tprofessionals, and those working towards certifications.\nThe full TCP/IP Guide is over 1,600 pages \n\tlong and is\navailable to license\nfor a low fee, with \n\tdiscounts for multiple orders. The material is also\navailable online, absolutely free\n. \n\tAnd now, it is also\navailable as a print book\n!\nNews\nSeptember 23, 2017:\nHello\n:\nWow, it has been a while since I updated this! And I know that the material has also gotten rather old at this point.\nI've had a lot of people ask me about updating The TCP/IP Guide, and this is something I've been wanting to do for years.\nUnfortunately, for a variety of reasons, it is unlikely that this will happen.\nThere are a number of reasons for this,\nsome having to do with my personal life and the needs of my family, and some having to do with the marketplace and how\npeople prefer to find and consume information these days. (Hint: It's not in 1,600 page print books.) This isn't ideal \nfor anyone, but unfortunately I have no choice, as it simply isn't practical for me to undertake this sort of project at this\nstage of my life and career. I hope you all understand, and continue to find the existing material useful going forward. \n\t(In truth, while a lot has changed, many of the fundamentals are actually \n\tpretty similar to how they were 15 years ago.)\nEnd of Direct Book Sales:\nIn a related move, I am discontinuing direct sales of the hardcover book. Orders \n\tof the book sent to me directly have dwindled, and \neach one required me to pack and ship the book individually, a time commitment better spent in other areas. I continue\nto sell the\ndownload edition\n, and of course the book can still be purchases at places like\nAmazon\n.\nGeneral Site Updates:\nI've updated \n\tseveral pages on this website to reflect the end of book sales and to \n\tmodernize some of the text (like removing references to 56k modems!)\nDecember 31, 2012:\nHappy New Year and Changes to TCP/IP \n\tElectronic and Book Sales:\nI have made some significant modifications to the front end of the website \n\t(the part you're reading now, that is, not the content) to reflect changes \n\tin how I am selling The TCP/IP Guide going forward. Specifically:\nI am no longer selling The TCP/IP Guide in \n\tCD form. This option was never very popular, and has become even less so as \n\thigh-speed Internet access has become universal. Having the various CD \n\toptions was confusing, and to top it off, I've also run out of the \n\tpressed CDs I ordered years ago, so I've just eliminated this option.\nBook orders now come with an electronic \n\tdownload rather than a CD. You can, of course, burn the information to a CD \n\tif you wish, but most people would rather have the PDF on a hard disk or \n\tflash drive anyway.\nI have moved from processing my own credit \n\tcards to using PayPal. The cost and the security risks associated with \n\thosting my own card processing had become unacceptable, and the use of PayPal is pretty \n\tuniversal at this point. This also opens up additional payment options, such \n\tas paying from a bank account or using a debit card.\nMy warmest wishes to all for a healthy and \n\tprosperous 2013.\nNovember 9, 2012:\nMinor Hacking Incident\n:\nHad a malware issue overnight. Everything has been fixed, but you may see \n\twarnings from Google etc. about this being a \"suspicious site\" until they \n\tcheck the place again and remove it from their list. Sorry for the trouble.\nMay 2, 2011:\nLaunch of the Online Freelancing Guide\n:\nThis isn't directly related to this site, but for those who like my writing, \n\tI'm pleased to announce the release of my new reference resource, the\nOnline Freelancing Guide\n. If \n\tyou're a freelancer, or ever considered becoming one, you'll find a ton of \n\tfantastic information on this site. And like all my sites, it's completely \n\tfree! :)\nJuly 28, 2010:\nBook Shipping Back to Normal:\nI am \n\tnow back to my normal book shipping schedule, and all pending orders \n\treceived during the first three weeks of July have been sent out. Thanks for your \n\tpatience.\nJune 28, 2010:\nTemporary Book Unavailability:\nFor \n\ttechnical reasons, I will be unable to ship books during the first three \n\tweeks of July. Any orders received during this time will be filled in the \n\tfinal week of the month. I apologize for any inconvenience! Note that\nelectronic version\nfulfillment is still \n\timmediate and a better option for those who cannot wait. Thanks for your \n\tunderstanding.\nJune 1, 2010:\nBooks Available and Another Increase:\nI'm pleased to announce that I have finally received shipment of the new \n\tprinting of The TCP/IP Guide book. Pending orders should ship out tomorrow \n\tmorning; thanks for your patience!\nOn the downside, I have been informed that the list price of the book has \n\tgone up by $10 as of this printing. This means that, unfortunately, I have \n\tto raise my prices again -- the timing stinks, since I hadn't raised prices \n\tin four years as of April, and now have had to do so twice within a few \n\tweeks!\nI'm absorbing half of this list price increase, so prices have gone up by \n\t$5, which is only enough to recoup the extra cost to me personally.  \n\tAny existing orders for the old prices will of course be honored. Thanks for \n\tyour understanding.\nApril 30, 2010:\nIt's Been a While!\nGreetings to all of my readers and customers! Sorry that I have taken such a \n\tlong time to update this front page; I always have a lot of things going on, \n\tbut five years is obviously too long to leave a front page sitting. I'll try \n\tto do better in the future.\nI'm pleased to say that The TCP/IP Guide continues to be a leading online \n\treference for TCP/IP material. I am still not away for any resource \n\tcomparable to it on the net.\nThe TCP/IP Guide in book form continues to be fairly popular, though the \n\tbook is now getting a bit older. I am in the early stages of discussion with \n\tmy publisher about a revision to the book, but if this happens, it won't be \n\tready for quite some time. Fortunately, most of what The TCP/IP Guide \n\tcontains is still quite relevant and useful (if I do say so myself!)\nBook Price Increase:\nOne advantage \n\tthat all of you have had due to my not updating this site for several years \n\tis that I also haven't changed my book prices in all of that time. And as we \n\tare all aware, the cost of fuel has increased greatly since 2005, leading to \n\thigher shipping charges as well. I've been absorbing those costs for many \n\tyears now, but am at \n\tthe point where I simply must slightly increase my prices. The cost of \n\tthe downloadable electronic version remains unchanged.\nTemporary Book Unavailability:\nThe \n\tprinter who handles The TCP/IP Guide is currently between printings and the \n\tbook is in short supply. I anticipate that I will be able to resume a full \n\tshipping schedule by the third week of May; any orders received until then \n\twill be held until I have books to send. Thanks for your patience.\n� 2003-2017 Charles M. Kozierok. All Rights Reserved.",

The TCP/IP Guide can \n\t\talso now be\nread online for free\n.\nWhat is the difference between a new order and an \n\t\tupgrade order of The TCP/IP Guide?\nAnyone who has previously placed \n\t\tan order for The TCP/IP Guide is eligible for special upgrade pricing; \n\t\tanyone who has not yet ordered must place a new order. There is no \n\t\tdifference in the material itself, only the price.\nHow does upgrade pricing work?\nIn general, downloaded \n\t\tupgrades to minor revisions of a purchased version are free; upgrades to \n\t\tthe next major revision or later are half price. For example, if you \n\t\tpurchase version 3.1, all revisions up to but not including 4.0 would be \n\t\tfree; version 4.0 and higher would be half price. (This rule has been \n\t\trelaxed for versions 2.0 and 3.0, which are available as minor revision \n\t\tupgrades.) See the\nversion history\nfor a discussion of minor and \n\t\tmajor revisions.\nHow often do you plan to publish upgrades of The \n\t\tTCP/IP Guide?\nMinor revisions to the Guide will be made on an \n\t\tas-needed basis; I plan to make major revisions every couple of years.\nCan I obtain a site license for The TCP/IP Guide?\nYes, by purchasing multiple licenses. See the\npricing page\nor\ncontact me\nfor more \n\t\tinformation.\nWhat is the price be for the hard-cover print \n\t\tversion of The TCP/IP Guide?\nThe book's MSRP is $99.95; it is \n\t\tavailable for less at many retailers, and also\nhere on the site\n(with extras!)\nOrder Process and Shipping Questions\nHow do I order The TCP/IP Guide?\nPlease follow \n\t\tthe instructions on the\nelectronic version ordering page\nor the\nbook ordering page\n.\nWhat forms of payment are accepted for orders?\nPrimary payment is via PayPal, the leading online payment method, which \n\t\tallows you to use debit or credit cards on a secure server. Alternate \n\t\tpayment forms, such as money order, can be sent by mail. I will accept cash as \n\t\twell, but I do not recommend this due to the possibility of loss; you \n\t\tsend it at your own risk.\nCan you accept purchase orders?\nYes, if this \n\t\tis really the only option available. I try to avoid them because they \n\t\tare extra work for me and usually result in delays of weeks to months \n\t\tbefore I receive payment.\nCan you accept bank transfers?\nGenerally no; \n\t\tthe banks here in the USA make this difficult and expensive.\nIn what currencies can you accept payments?\nOnly in US dollars, I'm afraid. Again, this is because of the banks \n\t\there.\nHow long does it take to process an order for The \n\t\tTCP/IP Guide?\nCredit card orders for download are usually processed \n\t\twithin a couple of hours, but may take longer due to the vagaries of \n\t\tInternet communication. Mail orders can take several days or even over a \n\t\tweek depending on the postal system and my schedule. Book orders will \n\t\ttake longer unless you upgrade to priority mail shipping.\nIf I order a book, can I get a download password to \n\t\tuse while waiting for it to arrive?\nSure, just\ncontact me\nand tell me that you would like this. There is no \n\t\tadditional charge.\nAre refunds accepted on orders of The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide?\nAs an individual running a small business, I do not have the \n\t\tresources to handle returns. If you order a book and there is a problem \n\t\tdue to a defect, I will of course exchange it at no charge.\nWhy do you sell books on the site only within the \n\t\tUS?\nThe book is heavy (almost six pounds) and the cost of air mail \n\t\tshipping, duty and taxes makes it likely not worth ordering from the US \n\t\tif you live outside the US. I may change this policy in the future if \n\t\tthere is sufficient demand.\nBook Questions\nWhere can I get more information on The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide in book form?\nPlease see the\nbook \n\t\tordering page\n.\nWhere is the book available?\nYou can order it \n\t\tfrom me directly (if you are in the US) or from your favorite online or \n\t\tbrick and mortar book store.\nWhat are the major differences between The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide's electronic and book versions?\nThe actual content of the two \n\t\teditions is basically the same, but they are arranged and formatted \n\t\tquite differently. The electronic version uses a hierarchical structure, \n\t\twhile the book is arranged into conventional chapters. The book was also \n\t\tsignificantly edited by the publisher so a lot of the writing appears \n\t\tdifferent. Finally, the diagrams are not in color in the book, and it \n\t\thas an index instead of a search engine.\nWhy is some of the content different between the \n\t\telectronic and book versions?\nThis is a result of the editing \n\t\tprocess that goes into producing a book for publication. Also, the book \n\t\tis a \"one shot\" deal; once it is done it can't be updated \n\t\t(except for a second edition in a few years), while the \n\t\telectronic version can be updated over time. But nearly all of the \n\t\tcontent is really the same.\nIs The TCP/IP Guide book hardcover or softcover?\nIt is a hardcover book.\nCan I get the book it autographed if I order it \n\t\tfrom you?\nSure, just specify this when ordering.\nCan I get a download copy when I buy a book?\nYes, if you buy directly from this site, the electronic version is \n\t\tincluded for free. It is not included if you purchase from any other \n\t\tsource.\nSystem Requirements Questions (Electronic Version)\nWhat are the system requirements to use The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide?\nThe TCP/IP Guide should be usable on all modern computers. \n\t\tHowever, as it is a very large document, very old systems may slow down \n\t\twhen displaying parts of it.\nWhat operating systems are supported?\nThe \n\t\tTCP/IP Guide is distributed as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file and \n\t\tshould therefore be usable on any system for which the Adobe Acrobat \n\t\tReader software is available. Adobe Acrobat 5.0 or later is required, \n\t\tbut certain people have reported difficulties using version 5, so \n\t\tAcrobat 6.0 or later is recommended.\nWhere can I get a copy of the Adobe Acrobat Reader \n\t\tsoftware?\nYou can\ndownload \n\t\tit for free from Adobe's Web site\n.\nAre there any known compatibility issues?\nNot \n\t\tat this time.\nHow large in size is The TCP/IP Guide?\nApproximately 27 MB.\nHow long does it take to download The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide?\nAbout 2.5 hours using a 28.8kbps dialup modem; about 1.3 \n\t\thours at 50kbps; and just a couple of minutes with modern high-speed \n\t\tbroadband.\n� 2003-2017 Charles M.

      "text_content": "The TCP/IP Guide -- Testimonials\nSite design by\nJunefire DTP\nView my photos online!\nTestimonials\nWith\nThe TCP/IP Guide \n\tprint book\nnow widely available, reviews and testimonials are pouring in \n\tfrom all around the world. Here are a few excerpts with links to the full \n\treviews:\n\"Really, the biggest drawback of\nThe TCP/IP Guide\nis that my \n\t\tattempts to describe it turn me into a slavering fanboy. My \n\t\tcubicle-mates stare wide-eyed at me and say in calming tones, \"Scott ... \n\t\tit's just a book.\" But geez, I literally cannot imagine anyone in IT who \n\t\twould not find this book eminently useful. It's a literary \"perfect \n\t\tstorm\" of great research, great organization, appealing prose, \n\t\tappropriate technical illustration, and clear-mindedness. I mean, what \n\t\telse do ya want? If you've read as many bad IT books as I have, you will \n\t\tappreciate the mastery of Kozierok's achievement. His warmth and style \n\t\tdon't smack you in the face at first (which is part of why it wears well \n\t\tover 1600 pages); but keep reading, and you'll discover an IT brother. \n\t\t...\n[The] TCP/IP Guide\nwill be the standard for years to come. \n\t\tYou heard it here first.\" --\nD. Scott Pinzon, CISSP\n,\nreview at WatchGuard Technologies, Inc.\n\"This is one of the \n\t\tmost comprehensive references available on the subject of TCP/IP.  At \n\t\tover 1,600 pages, author Charles Kozierok succeeds in organizing this \n\t\tinvolved subject into an introductory section, a general section for \n\t\tapplication developers, and one for low-level programmers who need \n\t\tdetailed access to the protocol.  Key concepts are sectioned off in \n\t\tbolded text on a gray background as a visual cue.  The many diagrams and \n\t\tillustrations are welcome in helping to explain the most complicated \n\t\tconcepts.  Kozierok's writing style is engaging and informative, \n\t\tespecially in the introductory chapters.\n... Now I can retire all \n\t\tmy other TCP/IP books I have gathering dust on my bookshelves. Oh, wait, \n\t\tI guess I can keep them as relics from times past and perhaps become \n\t\tcollector�s items. No, I looked at Amazon.com and they hold little value \n\t\ttoday. This book however may become timeless, because it not only talks \n\t\tabout, but shows �everything�.\" --\nJonathan Hoyle and Robert \n\t\tPritchett,\nreview at macCompanion\n\"Charles M. Kozierok's new\nTCP/IP Guide\nis the best-organized \n\t\tand easiest-to-digest \"complete\" TCP/IP book I've ever seen. ... I can't \n\t\tthink of a reason why any datacenter or beginning IT technician wouldn't \n\t\twant to own this volume. It's well written and organized, as complete as \n\t\tnearly everyone could want, contains many useful tables and diagrams, \n\t\tand covers IPv6, the forthcoming next generation of Internet \n\t\ttechnology.\" --\nJon Sobel,\nreview \n\t\tat blogcritics.org\n\"I'm blown away by this book. The coverage of the topics is \n\t\toutstanding in both it's breadth and depth. The tone is very readable. \n\t\tAnd the use of graphics, wow. This book is tremendous. It's going to \n\t\tinstantly be \"the TCP/IP reference\". It blows the old classic, TCP/IP \n\t\tIllustrated, straight out of the water. This book is worth every single \n\t\tpenny. No doubt. It's going to set a new bar for technical books. Wow.\" \n\t\t--\nJack D. Herrington,\nreview at amazon.com\n\"The TCP/IP Guide is a name that doesn't scratch the surface \n\t\tregarding how much thought and work went into this opus work by the \n\t\tauthor. At over 1,500+ pages, this is a reference, an encyclopedia, and \n\t\ta teaching tool all wrapped up into one. This isn't the kind of text \n\t\tthat anyone would just crack open and read in a weekend, but the most \n\t\texperienced of engineers WILL read this book cover to cover and find it \n\t\tan interesting journey to take. An amazing piece of work that will \n\t\tremain and thrive in networking circles for a long, long time to come. \" \n\t\t--\nDaniel McKinnon,\nreview at amazon.com\n\"I expect this book to become the new classic TCP IP reference.\" --\nkauza \"talltonga\",\nreview at amazon.com\n\"...for the last 10 years I have been an internet service provider \n\t\tso the Internet Protocols have been entrenched in my life and I wish I \n\t\thad this book from the beginning as it would have helped me tremendously \n\t\tback then. And now as a reference book on the subject, you could not \n\t\tfind a better, more comprehensive book on the subject. I would give it \n\t\ttwo thumbs up for sure.\" (Rating: 10 out of 10) --\nNick Sardy,\nreview at Cariboo Computer Magazine\nHere are a few of the many testimonials from people who \n\tare reading and using The TCP/IP Guide electronic edition:\n\"THANK YOU!!!!! I just had to say that. :) Finally, someone has \n\t\ttaken something as complex as the TCP/IP protocol and described it a \n\t\tsimple yet thorough manner that I can understand!! I purchased it on \n\t\tFriday and have been reading it all weekend. I started with the section \n\t\ton DNS and have learned more about it in one weekend than I have in my \n\t\t6+ years working with computers. Good work. I am so impressed with it \n\t\tthat I have been recommending it to all my co-workers and friends.\" -- \n\t\tJason E., Williamsport, PA\n\"I am\nso\ndelighted to see the next Major Step from this \n\t\tauthor. This is not\n\t\tan idle thought. I have been suggesting PCGuide.com to my students since \n\t\tthe\n\t\t1990's. This new entry *is critical* to CompTIA Network+ and lower level\n\t\tCisco candidates (CCNA/CCNP, CCDA). I also Strongly Suggest A+ 2003 and\n\t\tbeyond candidates become avid readers so they are REAL people, not just\n\t\tparrots making certification tests happy.\" --\nTcat Houser\n,\nauthor and educator\n\"I have found The TCP/IP Guide to be a surprisingly comprehensive \n\t\tmanual on an infinitely huge topic. The Guide offers not only a detailed \n\t\tview of the TCP/IP protocol suite, but also defines networking and the \n\t\tOSI model architecture, in a genuinely interesting and easy to digest \n\t\tmanner. Charles' relaxed, personal and humorous writing style makes \n\t\treading the Guide as enjoyable as a mystery novel. The multiple levels \n\t\tof detail - from simple overture to drilled down deep - makes The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide a valuable resource for any IT professional as well as an \n\t\texcellent text for students.\" --\nMary Richards, MCSE, A+\n\"Well, Charles Kozierok, creator of\nThe PC Guide\n, has done it \n\t\tagain! Written in his familiar down-to-earth style, The TCP/IP Guide is \n\t\tat once easy enough to understand that it should be an excellent \n\t\tstarting place for beginners to learn networking -- and at the same \n\t\ttime, thorough and in-depth enough to make it a must-have reference for \n\t\tadvanced users and professionals.\" -- Billy Griffis, computer technician\n\"Whenever I bump into troubles that seem even remotely \n\t\tTCP/IP-related, I dig out The TCP/IP Guide. It almost always gives me \n\t\tthe answer I seek, and most of the time I keep on reading. The clarity \n\t\twith which complex issues are explained, the omnipresent hyperlinks that \n\t\tallow you to go broad or deep on a given subject, the humorous writing \n\t\tstyle... It really makes for a captivating read and what's even more \n\t\timportant: a lot of the info really sticks in my head. A superb \n\t\treference work by any standard.\" --\nSteven, IT student, Belgium\n\"An absolute must-have for the serious student of networking, and \n\t\tthose who just want a greater understanding of the technical world \n\t\taround them. Its level of detail is excellent, yet its simple \n\t\texplanations and analogies of even the most complex subjects make this \n\t\twork unparalleled. Even for the experienced student its coverage of the \n\t\tbasics can make things so much clearer.\" --\nIain Denton, networking \n\t\tstudent, Tasmania, Australia\n\"I've started reading the full \n\t\tguide skimming through each section and so far it's definitely very high \n\t\tquality. The manner in which it's written is very professional and much \n\t\teasier to grasp then most technical books I've read. I love the use of \n\t\teasy to understand analogies, especially relating the host \n\t\tand network portion of an IP address to a telephone number. This guide \n\t\tis a must have for anyone serious about a future in computer networking.\" \n\t\t--\nEric Plumstead, networking student; Flemington, NJ\n\"What a magnum opus! Well \n\t\twritten, assuming little knowledge on the part of the reader, but, \n\t\tunlike many technical works, it is not patronising in tone. I think, if \n\t\tI finish reading it I might actually have learned a lot about \n\t\tnetworking. And painlessly too!\" --\nDavid Eaton, Somerset, England\n� 2003-2017 Charles M. Kozierok.

      "text_content": "The TCP/IP Guide -- Contact Information\nSite design by\nJunefire DTP\nView my photos online!\nContact Information\nOne of the ways that The TCP/IP Guide \n\tdiffers from the typical technical reference book is that it is a very \n\tpersonal work. When you read the Guide, I want you to feel like I am \n\texplaining the many technologies and concepts to you personally, because \n\tthat�s how I feel when I am writing. A published Guide of this sort is by \n\tits nature a type of �one-way� communication, from me to you; however, I am \n\talso interested in what you have to say to me. For this reason I strongly \n\tencourage you to provide me with feedback on this Guide and suggestions that \n\tyou may have for it. I am also interesteed in feedback on the\nfree version of The TCP/IP Guide\n.\nNOTE:\nSome users have reported problems with \n\tsearching when using version 5.x of Adobe Acrobat. This appears to be a bug \n\tI cannot resolve.\nUpgrading to version 6\nshould resolve the issue. Sorry for the \n\tinconvenience.\nHere are some of the areas where I would very much like \n\tyour feedback:\nError Reports:\nPlease don�t be shy about \n\t\treporting any errors you may find with this Guide, be they typos, \n\t\tmistakes in my reasoning, glitches in diagrams or anything else. Simply \n\t\tput, I�m not perfect, and I can�t fix problems that I don�t know exist. \n\t\tIf you do decide to report an error, please check the\nerrata page\nbefore contacting me. If your \n\t\tproblem is not mentioned there, please e-mail me (see below) and \n\t\tindicate clearly what version of the Guide you are using, and the topic \n\t\tname or page number where you found the problem.\nConstructive Criticisms and Suggestions for \n\t\tImprovement:\nIf there is something you don�t like about the \n\t\tmaterial, please tell me. Even better, make a suggestion for how to \n\t\timprove it.\nRequests For Additional Content:\nIs there an \n\t\tarea of the Guide where you wish I had gone into more detail, or a \n\t\tTCP/IP protocol you feel I should have covered but did not? Please feel \n\t\tfree to let me know.\nCompliments:\nIf you like The TCP/IP Guide, \n\t\tthen by all means please tell me, I won�t mind at all!\nQuestions About The Guide or Site:\nFeel free \n\t\tto send me questions that pertain directly to the use of The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide or this Web site, but please first check the site's\nfrequently asked questions (FAQ)\n.\nObviously I cannot guarantee that I will implement every \n\tidea or suggestion, but I will certainly consider each one. I also try to \n\talways respond to my e-mail personally, since I think it is rude for me not \n\tto reply when someone takes the time to provide me with feedback. (I do not, \n\thowever, usually bother to reply to �flaming� or rude e-mails.)\nThe only request I would make is this:\nplease do not \n\tcontact me with technical questions or requests for assistance\n. I�m a \n\tpretty busy guy and I get a lot of e-mail. I simply do not have the time to \n\thelp people with specific problems. Since I initially wrote\nThe PC Guide\nin 1997, I have \n\trepeatedly asked people not to send me technical questions, but they keep \n\tdoing it. I have now had to take the position of simply ignoring such \n\tmessages. Specifically, I will not respond to the following:\nRequests for network or PC design, setup, \n\t\tconfiguration or troubleshooting assistance. There are a number of \n\t\texcellent resources for assistance with these types of issues on the \n\t\tWeb, such as\nThe PC Guide \n\t\tDiscussion Forums\n.\nQuestions from exams, certification practice tests, \n\t\tand so forth. Please do your own homework, if you want to learn anything \n\t\tat all.\nRequests for me to write long treatises about TCP/IP \n\t\tprotocols or technologies that go beyond what this Guide already \n\t\tcontains. If you don�t find what you need in the Guide, try using \n\t\tanother TCP/IP book, or searching the Internet for the information you \n\t\tneed.

      "text_content": "The TCP/IP Guide -- Features\nSite design by\nJunefire DTP\nView my photos online!\nFeatures\nThe TCP/IP Guide is the culmination of over 4,000 hours \n\tof organization, writing, illustration and editing effort. All this work has \n\tbeen dedicated to one purpose: providing you with a Guide that is clear, \n\tunderstandable and easy to read, so you can learn about TCP/IP effectively \n\tand enjoyably. The TCP/IP Guide includes numerous features that help it to \n\tachieve this goal. I have divided these features into two groups: those \n\tassociated with the Guide's material and structure, and those related to its \n\tpresentation and use.\nThe following are the most important content-related \n\tfeatures of The TCP/IP Guide (some apply only to the electronic edition, not \n\tthe print book):\nExtensive Coverage:\nThe TCP/IP Guide is over 1,600 pages in \n\t\tlength, and covers dozens of different TCP/IP protocols and \n\t\ttechnologies. It includes far more details on key TCP/IP protocols than \n\t\tmost comparable general resources.\nUser-Selectable Detail:\nMost of the sections of The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide include both an overview topic that provides a high-level look at \n\t\ta protocol or concept, and a fully-detailed section for those who want \n\t\tto delve into the subject more deeply. This allows you to choose the \n\t\tlevel of detail you require. References are also provided to the \n\t\tdefining standards for each protocol, if you want to read even more \n\t\tinformation.\nInformative \"Key Concept\" Summaries:\nThe TCP/IP Guide \n\t\tincludes hundreds of \"key concepts\" summary paragraphs, which help you \n\t\tquickly understand the critical concepts in understanding TCP/IP. They \n\t\tare also useful for reviewing material you have previously studied.\nNotes, Background and Related Information Inserts:\nWhere \n\t\tappropriate, special \"inserts\" in the text call attention to tangential \n\t\tinformation, or make specific reference to recommended prerequisite or \n\t\trelated information elsewhere in the Guide.\nHierarchical Organization:\nThe TCP/IP Guide is organized \n\t\tusing a hierarchical structure, rather than just having dozens of \n\t\tunrelated chapters listed in sequence. This allows you to see at a \n\t\tglance how the various components, concepts and protocols are \n\t\tcategorized and how they relate to each other.\nComplete Explanations:\nThe TCP/IP Guide endeavors to not only \n\t\tdescribe the \"what\" of TCP/IP, but also the \"how\" and the \"why\". It \n\t\tanticipates common questions and concerns that someone learning the \n\t\tmaterial might have, identifies potentially confusing concepts, and \n\t\texplains them completely.\nHigh Understandability:\nDespite including a lot of detail, \n\t\tThe TCP/IP Guide has been specifically written to be understandable. It \n\t\tdoes not assume that you are already a networking expert.\nExcellent Readability:\nThe TCP/IP Guide is written in a \n\t\tfirst-person, casual, friendly style to help prevent you from getting \n\t\tbored as you read it. You will feel more like a friend is explaining how \n\t\tTCP/IP works than a professor is lecturing to you.\nUp-To-Date Material:\nThe descriptions in the TCP/IP Guide are \n\t\tup to date, based on changes made to key technologies (including \n\t\tInternet Protocol version 6, IPv6) through the start of 2004.\nHigh-Quality Illustrations:\nThe TCP/IP includes over 300 \n\t\thigh-quality, full-color diagrams. Most of these include a caption that \n\t\tallows you to quickly understand them without having to read the entire \n\t\taccompanying text.\nHelpful Examples:\nTo help make difficult material easier to \n\t\tunderstand, most discussions include examples to supplement the regular \n\t\tdescriptions of technologies and concepts. Many of these are \n\t\tillustrated.\nTables For Data Presentation:\nThe TCP/IP Guide includes over \n\t\t300 tables to neatly present large amounts of data, and for other \n\t\tpurposes such as exhibiting sample files and output.\nThese features enhance the presentation and usability of the electronic \n\tversion of the Guide:\nElectronic Distribution:\nThe TCP/IP Guide has been designed \n\t\tfrom the start for electronic presentation and takes advantage of its \n\t\tmany benefits. These include low cost, instant download (when purchasing \n\t\tover the Internet), portability, scalability, hyperlinking, searching \n\t\tand more.\nStandard PDF Format:\nThe TCP/IP Guide is distributed in \n\t\tstandard PDF format, and can be used with Adobe Acrobat software version \n\t\t5 or higher, available on virtually all computer platforms.\nPDF Bookmark Table of Contents:\nThe TCP/IP Guide uses PDF \n\t\tbookmarks to present its table of contents on the left side of the \n\t\tscreen. This allows you to refer to the structure of the Guide at any \n\t\ttime while you read the material, and jump to any topic at will.\nHyperlinked Table of Contents, List of Figures and List of \n\t\tTables:\nAll topics, figures and tables are listed near the front of \n\t\tthe TCP/IP Guide and every entry is hyperlinked for your convenience.\nThousands of Cross-Topic Hyperlinks:\nIn addition to the links \n\t\tmentioned just above, there are over 3,000 hyperlinks between topics. \n\t\tThis allows you to quickly jump to the place where a concept or \n\t\ttechnology is defined when you see it used in a related discussion.\nHigh-Speed Full-Text Search:\nThe TCP/IP Guide comes with an \n\t\telectronic text index that lets you instantly find all occurrences of \n\t\tany word or phrase in the document, and jump from one reference to the \n\t\tnext. More advanced search options are also available.\n� 2003-2017 Charles M. Kozierok. All Rights Reserved.",

      "text_content": "The TCP/IP Guide -- Content Overview\nSite design by\nJunefire DTP\nView my photos online!\nContent Overview\nThe TCP/IP Guide provides a thorough description \n\tof the TCP/IP protocol suite, as well as additional materials needed by any \n\tstudent of internetworking. The Guide begins with a fundamentals section \n\tcontaining essential background information, and a complete discussion of \n\tthe OSI Reference Model. It then describes the TCP/IP protocol suite in \n\tgeneral terms, before exploring the specific protocols that comprise it. \n\tExtensive discussion is provided of both the core protocols that make TCP/IP \n\tinternetworks function, and the most important classical TCP/IP \n\tapplications.\nThe description of each protocol includes examples, \n\tillustrations and discussions of how the protocol was developed and its role \n\tin the TCP/IP suite as a whole. Amongst the protocols covered by The TCP/IP \n\tGuide are (in increasing layer order): SLIP, PPP, IP, IPv6, IP NAT, IPSec, \n\tMobile IP, ICMP, ICMPv6, IPv6 ND, RIP, OSPF, GGP, HELLO, IGRP, EIGRP, BGP, \n\tEGP, TCP, UDP, DNS, NFS, BOOTP, DHCP, SNMP, RMON, FTP, TFTP, RFC 822, MIME, \n\tSMTP, POP3, IMAP, NNTP, HTTP, Telnet and IRC.\nThe following is a more complete description of the major content areas \n\tof the download or CD versions of The TCP/IP Guide (for even more detail than this, please view the full\nTable of Contents\n). Of course, you can also check out \n\tthe entire Guide for yourself by reading the\nfree \n\tonline version\n:\nNetworking Fundamentals:\nA general discussion of important \n\t\tbackground material that those learning about networks need to know. \n\t\tIncludes a look at the benefits and disadvantages of networking, a \n\t\treview of key networking characteristics and network types and sizes, a \n\t\tdiscussion of network performance issues, explanation of networking \n\t\tstandards issues and organizations, and a backgrounder on computing \n\t\tmathematics (including octal and hexadecimal numbers, conversions and \n\t\tbit masking.)\nOSI Reference Model:\nA complete description of the ISO\nOpen \n\t\tSystem Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model\n. This section covers the \n\t\treasons why the OSI model is important, discusses essential concepts and \n\t\tterminology, and describes each model layer individually. It also has an \n\t\texample and summary table.\nTCP/IP Overview:\nThe first section about TCP/IP itself \n\t\tprovides a high-level overview of the suite. This includes a brief \n\t\tdiscussion of its history, TCP/IP architecture, TCP/IP's client/server \n\t\tmodel of operation, and a summary table of TCP/IP protocols and their \n\t\tlayers.\nTCP/IP Network Interface Protocols:\nA full discussion of the \n\t\trole and function of network interface (layer two) TCP/IP protocols, \n\t\tused to enable TCP/IP to work directly over physical links. This section \n\t\tprovides a brief description of the\nSerial Line Interface Protocol \n\t\t(SLIP)\nand a complete discussion of the\nPoint-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\n, \n\t\tincluding link setup, PPP's constituent subprotocols, and features such \n\t\tas compression, encryption and multilink PPP.\nTCP/IP Address Resolution Protocols:\nA description of the \n\t\timportance of address resolution, a full discussion of the\nAddress \n\t\tResolution Protocol (ARP)\n, including caching and proxying, and a brief \n\t\texplanation of the\nReverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)\n.\nInternet Protocol (IP):\nExtensive coverage of the\nInternet \n\t\tProtocol (IP)\nincluding an overview and history, addressing, datagram \n\t\tencapsulation, fragmentation and reassembly, and routing.\nIP Addressing:\nAlmost 100 pages are devoted just to IP \n\t\taddressing alone. The subjects covered here are addressing concepts and \n\t\tstructures, addressing types, IPv4 address classes, multicast \n\t\taddressing, subnet addressing, variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) and \n\t\tclassless addressing (CIDR). A complete section is also provided that \n\t\tshows step by step how to subnet a network, with multiple examples.\nInternet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6):\nOne of the most \n\t\tcomprehensive descriptions of the new and essential version 6 of the \n\t\tInternet Protocol, outside of books dedicated to that subject. This \n\t\tsection discusses why IPv6 is important, and covers all the key changes \n\t\tbetween IPv4 and IPv6. It extensively discusses IPv6 addressing types \n\t\tand issues, IPv6 datagram formatting, IPv6 extension headers and \n\t\toptions, and how datagrams are fragmented and routed in IPv6.\nIP-Related Protocols:\nThree sections that cover in detail \n\t\timportant protocols closely related to IP. The first discusses\nIP \n\t\tNetwork Address Translation (IP NAT)\n, showing how four different types \n\t\tof network translation work. The second is on\nIP Security (IPSec)\n, and \n\t\tdiscusses IPSec architecture, tunnel and transport modes, security \n\t\tassociations, and the authentication header (AH) and encapsulating \n\t\tsecurity payload (ESP). The third describes fully how\nMobile IP\ncan be \n\t\tused to support TCP/IP operation on traveling nodes.\nIP Support Protocols:\nA full discussion of two protocols that \n\t\tsupport the operation of IP. The\nInternet Control Message Protocol\nis \n\t\tdescribed fully for both IP and IPv6 (\nICMP and ICMPv6\n), including a \n\t\tdescription of each of the ICMP message types. The\nNeighbor Discovery \n\t\t(ND)\nprotocol is also described for IPv6.\nTCP/IP Routing Protocols:\nWhile not specifically devoted to \n\t\trouting, The TCP/IP Guide provides a fairly detailed discussion of \n\t\trouting protocol issues, and covers the\nRouting Information Protocol \n\t\t(RIP)\n,\nOpen Shortest Path First (OSPF)\nand\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP)\nrouting protocols fairly comprehensively. Other routing protocols are \n\t\talso described more briefly:\nGGP\n,\nHELLO\n,\nIGRP\n,\nEIGRP\n, and\nEGP\n.\nTCP/IP Transport Protocols:\nA description of transport layer \n\t\taddressing (ports and sockets) and the two TCP/IP transport layer \n\t\tprotocols: the\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP)\nand\nTransmission Control \n\t\tProtocol (TCP)\n. The critically-important and often complicated TCP is \n\t\tcovered extensively in over 100 pages. This includes a discussion of TCP \n\t\tfunctions and characteristics, and a fully-illustrated explanation of \n\t\tsliding windows, TCP streams and segments, TCP connection establishment \n\t\tand management, message formatting, retransmission mechanisms, flow \n\t\tcontrol, window size adjustment, and congestion avoidance.\nTCP/IP Name Systems:\nA description of the general concepts \n\t\tbehind name systems, the use of host tables, and the TCP/IP\nDomain Name \n\t\tSystem (DNS)\n. The section on DNS covers its components and functions, \n\t\tthe DNS name space structure and notation, DNS name registration and \n\t\ttop-level domains, DNS resource records and name server operation, DNS \n\t\tresolvers, name resolution and caching, and DNS message transfer and \n\t\tmaster file format.\nTCP/IP Network File System:\nA quick look at the\nNetwork File \n\t\tSystem (NFS)\n, showing how it can be used to allow users to seamlessly \n\t\tshare resources across an internetwork. This includes a discussion of \n\t\tNFS architecture, data storage, client/server operation and the Mount \n\t\tProtocol.\nTCP/IP Host Configuration Protocols:\nTwo technologies used to \n\t\tallow devices to be automatically configured: the\nBoot Protocol (BOOTP)\nand\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\n. The DHCP section \n\t\texplains how DHCP leases work, the processes of lease allocation, \n\t\treallocation, renewal, rebinding and release, DHCP message formats, DHCP \n\t\tserver and client operation, security issues and more.\nTCP/IP Network Management Protocols:\nA full coverage of the\nSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\n. This includes a discussion of \n\t\tthe many often-confusing SNMP versions, the Structure of Management \n\t\tInformation (SMI), Management Information Bases (MIBs), the operation of \n\t\tthe SNMP protocol itself, and\nRemote Monitoring (RMON)\n.\nTCP/IP General File Transfer Protocols:\nA section describing \n\t\tthe operation of the\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP)\nand\nTrivial File \n\t\tTransfer Protocol (TFTP)\n. The FTP section covers the FTP operational \n\t\tmodel, control and data connections, port usage, communication and \n\t\ttransfer modes, and command and reply codes.\nTCP/IP Electronic Mail Protocols:\nE-mail is one of the most \n\t\timportant applications on the modern Internet; since it is really a \n\t\tsystem of related protocols and technologies, The TCP/IP Guide describes \n\t\tit accordingly. The discussion includes an overview of electronic mail, \n\t\ta look at addressing methods and message formats (including regular\nRFC \n\t\t822\nand enhanced\nMIME\nmessages), and coverage of the\nSimple Mail \n\t\tTransfer Protocol (SMTP)\n,\nPost Office Protocol (POP3)\nand\nInternet \n\t\tMessage Access Protocol (IMAP)\n.\nTCP/IP Usenet System and Protocols:\nA description of the \n\t\tUsenet newsgroup communication system, with particular emphasis on the \n\t\toperation of the\nNetwork News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)\n.\nTCP/IP World Wide Web:\nThe World Wide Web is arguably the \n\t\tmost important application in the history of networking; The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide describes the Web in general terms, including a brief look at \n\t\tUniform Resource Locators (URLs) and the Hypertext Markup Language \n\t\t(HTML). Most of the section is devoted to a comprehensive explanation of \n\t\tthe\nHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\n, including connections, \n\t\tpipelining, message formats, methods, status codes, media types, data \n\t\ttransfer, content negotiation, caching, proxying, security issues and \n\t\tstate management.\nTCP/IP Interactive and Remote Application Protocols:\nA brief \n\t\tdescription of the important\nTelnet\nprotocol, used for interactive \n\t\tremote host access.

      "text_content": "The TCP/IP Guide -- Samples\nSite design by\nJunefire DTP\nView my photos online!\nSamples\nI have created ten sample excerpts from The \n\tTCP/IP Guide to allow you to see what it looks like in its full PDF form. This includes \n\tfour individual topics and two \n\tcomplete sections taken from the current version of the Guide, provided in PDF form just \n\tlike The TCP/IP Guide itself. If you are trying to assess the content of The \n\tTCP/IP Guide to determine if you want to buy it, I recommend reading the\nfree online version of The TCP/IP Guide\n.\nNOTICE:\nThe samples \n\treferenced on this page are part of The TCP/IP Guide and protected under \n\tUnited States and international copyright law. You are granted authorization \n\tto download and examine the documents to determine if The TCP/IP Guide suits \n\tyour needs. Other than this use, no part of these documents may be \n\treproduced, distributed, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any \n\tform or by any means�be it electronic, mechanical, photographic, magnetic or \n\totherwise�without the prior written permission of the author. If you \n\tdisagree with these terms, do not download the samples.\nSome important notes about these sample documents:\nAdobe Acrobat Reader Required:\nYou must have the Adobe \n\t\tAcrobat PDF Reader, version 5 or higher, to read these sample documents. You \n\t\tcan\ndownload \n\t\tthe latest version for free from Adobe's Web site\n.\nContext of Samples:\nSome of the individual topic samples \n\t\tcover advanced subjects and are included to show the depth of detail in \n\t\tThe TCP/IP Guide. If you are new to networking,\nplease do not be \n\t\tconcerned\nif these seem hard to understand; this is largely because \n\t\tyou are seeing a topic without the other topics that go with it in its \n\t\tsection. All difficult concepts in The TCP/IP Guide are introduced \n\t\tthoroughly with overview information that allows nearly anyone to \n\t\tunderstand how the technologies work. Again, please refer to the\nfree online version of The TCP/IP Guide\nto \n\t\tsee the context of the samples.\nHyperlinks Non-Functional:\nBlue text is used in The TCP/IP \n\t\tGuide for hyperlinks to topics, sections, tables and figures. These \n\t\tlinks are shown but most are not functional in the samples.\nVariations From Complete Document:\nThere may be very minor \n\t\tdifferences between these samples and the corresponding topics in the \n\t\tcomplete Guide.\nThe following are complete sections from The TCP/IP Guide, each covering \n\tbetween 15 and 20 pages of material:\nFundamental Network \n\t\tCharacteristics\n:\nA full section from the Networking Fundamentals chapter that \n\t\tshows how The TCP/IP Guide provides essential information for those new \n\t\tto networking. This section describes protocols in general terms, \n\t\tdifferentiates circuit-switching and packet-switching networks, \n\t\tdiscusses connectionless and connection-oriented protocols, explains how \n\t\tmessages are named and formatted, covers different types of addressing, \n\t\tand contrasts client/server and peer-to-peer networking.\nIP Subnetting: Practical Subnet \n\t\tDesign and Address Determination Example\n:\nThis five-topic \n\t\tsection describes in detail, using examples and diagrams, how to subnet \n\t\tan IP network. It covers the design tradeoff in choosing the number of \n\t\tbits for the subnet ID, determining the subnet mask, deriving subnet \n\t\tidentifiers and addresses, and finding host addresses for each subnet. \n\t\t(Note that preceding this section in the full Guide is another section \n\t\tthat thoroughly covers subnetting concepts, for those new to IP \n\t\taddressing.)\nThe following are four individual topics, with a brief description of each:\nData Encapsulation, Protocol Data \n\t\tUnits (PDUs) and Service Data Units (SDUs)\n:\nA selection from the \n\t\tdiscussion of the OSI Reference Model that describes the OSI terminology \n\t\tfor messages, and how data is encapsulated as it is transferred between \n\t\tprotocol layers.\nIP Datagram General Format\n:\nA detailed description of \n\t\tthe datagram format of the critically important Internet Protocol (IP). \n\t\tThis sample shows how The TCP/IP Guide puts tables and diagrams to good \n\t\tuse in explaining complex technologies and concepts.\nMobile IP Overview, History and \n\t\tMotivation\n:\nAn example of an overview topic, which shows how The \n\t\tTCP/IP Guide introduces and provides a general explanation of a \n\t\ttechnology, in this case, Mobile IP.\nDNS Basic Name Resolution \n\t\tTechniques: Iterative and Recursive Resolution\n:\nA discussion of \n\t\tthe differences between the two main techniques used for name resolution \n\t\tin the TCP/IP Domain Name System (DNS).\nIf there are any problems with these samples or you have comments on \n\tthem, feel free to\ncontact me\n.\n� 2003-2017 Charles M.

      "text_content": "The TCP/IP Guide -- Version History\nSite design by\nJunefire DTP\nView my photos online!\nVersion History\nLike all technical documents, The \n\tTCP/IP Guide must be revised on a regular basis, to correct problems and \n\tmake updates to reflect changing technology. The fact that the Guide is \n\tself-published in electronic form allows it to be updated much more often \n\tthan is possible with a printed book. To differentiate between successive \n\trevisions of the Guide, I use a version numbering system; the version \n\tnumber of the Guide is displayed in the footer of each page of the document.\nThe version number takes the form �N.N�, where each �N� is \n\tan integer. The right-most digit is the minor version number; it is \n\tincremented whenever a new version of the Guide is published that contains \n\tonly relatively minor fixes and improvements. The left-most digit is the \n\tmajor version number, and is changed only when significant changes are made \n\tto the Guide, such as a large number of fixes and enhancements, or the \n\taddition of substantial new content.\nThe following table shows the version history of The \n\tTCP/IP Guide:\nVersion #\nDate\nDescription\nand Changes from\n    Previous Versions\n1.0\nJanuary 1, 2004\nInitial release of The \n\tTCP/IP Guide.\n2.0\nJune 7, 2004\nExtensive rewrite of \n\tversion 1.0 of The TCP/IP Guide.\nThe \n\tGuide was thoroughly reviewed by two TCP/IP experts and numerous technical \n\terrors and clarity problems were addressed. Most of the larger topics have \n\thad subheaders added to make them more readable. Hundreds of other minor \n\tglitches, typos and problems have also been corrected.\n3.0\nSeptember 27, 2005\nThis is actually a minor \n\tupdate to version 2.0, containing a few dozen error corrections and \n\tclarifications. This version corresponds to the content of the newly \n\treleased print book of The TCP/IP Guide (which is why it was given version \n\tnumber 3.0 instead of 2.1.)\n� 2003-2017 Charles M. Kozierok.

It is a \n\thardcover, professionally bound book that is 1,616 pages in length and \n\tincludes the same basic content as version 3.0 of the electronic edition of \n\tThe TCP/IP Guide. It has the same text and diagrams (in black and white) and \n\tadds a full index.\nThe book is being distributed through normal commercial channels \n\tand should be available through most online and brick and mortar book \n\tstores. The list price of the book $99.95 in the United States, but it is \n\tavailable for much lower prices at many online discounters. For example,\nit \n\tis currently around $60 at Amazon.com\n.\nFor many years I also sold the book directly, but due to \n\tdwindling sales, my inability to compete price-wise with sites like Amazon, \n\tand the time commitment required to manually process orders and ship books, \n\tI have discontinued this service.

The reason for this is simple: TCP/IP is\neverywhere\n! \r\nIt is today by far the most commonly-used internetworking protocol suite. \r\nIt has gained prominence in large part due to its role in operating \r\nthe global Internet, which has in a few short years transformed our \r\nsociety in so many ways. Millions of people use TCP/IP and the Internet \r\nwithout really knowing how they work. For those in the technology field, \r\nhowever, understanding TCP/IP is becoming more important with each passing \r\nyear.\nAs we journey together through this \r\nTCP/IP Guide, we will explore many hundreds of pages of material that \r\nwill explain both the generalities and specifics of TCP/IP in a way \r\nthat I hope you will find educational and interesting. Before diving \r\ninto the actual technology, however, I felt that I should provide you \r\nwith some introductory material to help frame the discussions that follow. \r\nThus, I have included this section, to serve as an introduction to this \r\nGuide and to provide some information that will help you use it to its \r\nfull potential.\nI begin with some material that will \r\nbe of interest to those who want to know the background of The TCP/IP \r\nGuide. I provide a general introduction to the Guide, describing its \r\nhistory, and how it came about. I then describe the goals of this Guide \r\nand what I was trying to accomplish in writing it. I also discuss the \r\nscope of the Guide, so you know what it covers and what it does not.\nThe rest of the section contains \r\nmore practical information to help you best utilize this rather large \r\nsite. I introduce the Guide, and explain how it is structured and organized. \r\nI then explain its special features and how they can help you learn \r\nabout TCP/IP. I then provide some specific tips to help you navigate \r\nthe Guide using your Web browser. I conclude with a notice about copyright, \r\nsome important acknowledgments, and a bit of information about me.\nNote:\nThere is no actual technical content in this section. If you are the type who buys something and starts using it right away without cracking open the manual, you may want to skip this section. If so, you should start by looking at the high-level discussion of the\nTCP/IP protocol suite\n; alternately, you may wish to begin at the\nNetworking Fundamentals\nsection or with a look at the\nOSI Reference Model\n. However, I do recommend at least skimming the topics in this section before you move on, especially the topics discussing the structure and organization of the Guide and its features. This will make the rest of the Guide easier to understand and probably save you time in the long run.\nQuick navigation to\nsubsections\nand\nregular topics\nin this section\nIntroduction To The TCP/IP Guide\nGoals of The TCP/IP Guide\nScope of The TCP/IP Guide\nStructure and Organization of The TCP/IP Guide\n(Parts:\n1\n2\n)\nTCP/IP Guide Features, Inserts and Icons\n(Parts:\n1\n2\n)\nTips For Navigating the Online Version of The TCP/IP Guide\nCopyright Notice and Disclaimers\nAcknowledgments\nAbout The Author\nThe TCP/IP Guide\n1\nIntroduction To The TCP/IP Guide\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

Organizing and structuring this much material into a Web site \r\nthat is easy to read and navigate is a challenge. I spent quite a bit \r\nof time designing the site and including navigation features that I \r\nhope will make it easy for you to use.\nHere are some tips for understanding \r\nhow the material is organized and how best to navigate through it:\nSections, Topics and Pages:\nAs explained\nearlier \r\nin this Introduction\n, The TCP/IP Guide \r\nuses a hierarchical structure of\nsections\nthat contain\nsubsections\n, \r\nwhich may in turn be divided into further subsections as well as individual\ntopics\n. Because some topics are very long, many have been broken \r\ninto\npages\n. There are over 1,500 sections, topics and pages on \r\nthis site.\nHierarchy Navigation:\nNear the top of \r\neach page of the site you will see in a purple-outlined box a cascading \r\nset of links that reflect your current position in The TCP/IP organizational \r\nstructure. You can click any of these links to go up one or more levels \r\nin the hierarchy. For example, the hierarchy navigation for the topic \r\nyou are now reading shows it is within the section\nThe \r\nTCP/IP Guide: Introduction and \"Guide To The Guide\"\n, \r\nwhich is in turn under\nThe TCP/IP Guide\n.\nAccessing the Table Of Contents:\nTo the \r\nleft of the hierarchy navigation box is the table of contents button. \r\nClick it to bring up\nthe full contents of \r\nThe TCP/IP Guide\n.\nNext/Previous Section/Topic Navigation:\nAt the top and bottom of each page is a solid purple box that contains \r\nbuttons and links for moving sequentially through the Guide. On the \r\nfar left and far right of this box are text links and large arrows that \r\ntake you directly to the start of the previous or next full topic or \r\nsection. These always take you to the first page of any topic that has \r\nmultiple pages, to allow you to skip all the pages of any topic you \r\ndon’t want to read.\nDirect Page Navigation:\nIn the middle \r\nof the purple box you will see a navigation display for moving easily \r\nthrough the pages of a topic. Each page number is listed, with the current \r\npage shown in white text on a dark background, and the other pages hyperlinked \r\nfor easy direct access.\nNext/Previous Page Navigation:\nYou will \r\nalso see in the purple box smaller arrows that take you to the previous \r\nor next page of The TCP/IP Guide. The small left arrow goes to the previous \r\npage of the current topic, or if you are on its first (or only) page, \r\nthe last page of the previous topic. The right arrow goes to the next \r\npage of the current topic, or if you are on its last (or only) page, \r\ntakes you to the first page of the next topic. You can use these arrow \r\nto move sequentially through the entire TCP/IP Guide.\nText Links:\nAt the bottom of each page \r\nare a set of text links that take you to The TCP/IP Guide home page, \r\nthe Table of Contents, and the page where you can contact me with questions \r\nor feedback.\nThat’s pretty much it!

Unlike many other resources, however, I did not want \r\nto start with the assumption that my reader knew what networking was \r\nall about. After all, that's why you are reading this Guide!\nSo, I decided to include this section, \r\nwhich provides an overview of some of the basic issues related to networking. \r\nThis area is where I place discussions of some of the most fundamental \r\nnetworking concepts and ideas. It serves not only to provide you, the \r\nreader, with useful background material, but also as a repository for \r\n“general” information so that I don't need to repeat it in \r\nmany different places elsewhere in the Guide. This in turn allows those \r\nwho already know about these basics to avoid having to skip over them \r\nin many other locations.\nIn this section I have provided several \r\nsubsections that introduce networking and talk about some of its most \r\nimportant fundamental concepts. First, I introduce networking in very \r\nbroad terms, discussing what it is and why it is important. Then, I \r\ndescribe several fundamental characteristics of networks that you will \r\nneed to understand the various networking technologies. I discuss the \r\ndifferent general types and sizes of networks and how they are differentiated. \r\nI then talk about many different matters related to network performance. \r\nI explain the importance of networking standards and standards organizations. \r\nFinally, I provide a background section that describes the fundamentals \r\nof how data is stored and manipulated in computers; if you are new to \r\ncomputing you may find that information useful when reading some parts \r\nof this Guide.\nNote:\nIf you are experienced in networking and related technologies, you may wish to skip this chapter. Hyperlinks in other areas of the Guide refer back here as appropriate, so if you need to “fill in” your knowledge of a particular fundamental “on the fly” you can do so rather easily.\nNote:\nThis section discusses fundamental networking issues that may be of use in understanding certain TCP/IP concepts. However, some of the material is very broadly oriented towards discussions of networking as a whole and is not specific to TCP/IP internetworking.\nQuick navigation to\nsubsections\nand\nregular topics\nin this section\nIntroduction to Networking\nFundamental Network Characteristics\nTypes and Sizes of Networks\nNetwork Performance Issues and Concepts\nNetwork Standards and Standards Organizations\nBackgrounder: Data Representation and the Mathematics of Computing\nAbout The Author\n1\nIntroduction to Networking\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

When it comes \r\nto networking, there are several models that are used to explain the \r\nroles played by various technologies, and how they interact. Of these, \r\nthe most popular and commonly used is the\nOpen Systems Interconnection \r\n(OSI) Reference Model\n.\nThe idea behind the OSI Reference \r\nModel is to provide a framework for both designing networking systems \r\nand for explaining how they work. As you read about networking, you \r\nwill frequently find references to the various levels, or\nlayers\n, \r\nof the OSI Reference Model. The existence of the model makes it easier \r\nfor networks to be analyzed, designed, built and rearranged, by allowing \r\nthem to be considered as modular pieces that interact in predictable \r\nways, rather than enormous, complex monoliths.\nIn fact, it's pretty much impossible \r\nto read a lot about networking without encountering discussions that \r\npresume at least some knowledge of how the OSI Reference Model works. \r\nThis is why I strongly advise that if you are new to the OSI Reference \r\nModel, you read this chapter carefully. While it is all arguably “background \r\nmaterial”, reading it will help form an important foundation in \r\nyour understanding of networks, and will make the rest of the Guide \r\nmake more sense at the same time.\nIf you are quite familiar with the \r\nOSI Reference Model, you may wish to skip this chapter of the Guide, \r\nor just skim through it. You can always return later to brush up on \r\nparticular issues, as needed. There are also many links that come back \r\nto the descriptions of the individual layers from various parts of the \r\nGuide.\nIn the pages that follow, I describe \r\nthe OSI Reference Model in detail. I begin with a history of the model, \r\nand a discussion of some general concepts related to the OSI model and \r\nnetworking models overall. I provide a useful analogy to help you understand \r\nhow the reference model works to explain the interaction of networks \r\non multiple levels. I then describe each of the seven layers of the \r\nOSI Reference Model, and conclude with a summary of the layers and their \r\nrespective functions.\nNote:\nThis section describing the OSI Reference Model is geared to a discussion of networks and internetworks in general, and not specifically to the TCP/IP protocol suite. Therefore, not all of the material in this section is directly relevant to learning about TCP/IP, though much of it is. You may also wish to refer to\nthe topic covering the reference model that describes TCP/IP\n, which also discusses how the TCP/IP and OSI models compare.\nQuick navigation to\nsubsections\nand\nregular topics\nin this section\nHistory of the OSI Reference Model\nGeneral Reference Model Issues\nKey OSI Reference Model Concepts\nUnderstanding The OSI Reference Model: An Analogy\nOSI Reference Model Layers\nOSI Reference Model Layer Mnemonics\nOSI Reference Model Layer Summary\nBit Masking (Setting, Clearing and Inverting) Using Boolean Logical Functions\n1\nHistory of the OSI Reference Model\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

Named for two key protocols of the many that \r\ncomprise it, TCP/IP has been in continual development and use for about \r\nthree decades. In that time, it has evolved from an experimental technology \r\nused to hook together a handful of research computers, to the powerhouse \r\nof the largest and most complex computer network in history: the global \r\nInternet, connecting together millions of networks and end devices.\nIn this section I begin our magical \r\ntour through the mystical world of TCP/IP.\nJ\nI begin with an overview of TCP/IP and a brief look at its very interesting \r\nhistory. I discuss the services provided in TCP/IP networks, and then \r\nexplain the architectural model used under TCP/IP. I then provide a \r\nbrief description of each of the most important TCP/IP protocols that \r\nare discussed in this Guide.\nYou may have noticed that this section \r\nis relatively small, even though its title seems to encompass the entire \r\nsubject of this TCP/IP Guide. The reason is that this section only provides \r\na high-level overview of TCP/IP. Most of the content of the Guide is \r\nconcerned with explaining the several dozen individual protocols that \r\ncomprise TCP/IP; these can be found in other sections and subsections \r\nof the Guide. For convenience, you can also find direct links to the \r\ndescriptions of these protocols in the\nTCP/IP Protocols\ntopic in this section.\nQuick navigation to\nsubsections\nand\nregular topics\nin this section\nTCP/IP Overview and History\n(Parts:\n1\n2\n3\n)\nTCP/IP Services and Client/Server Operation\n(Parts:\n1\n2\n3\n)\nTCP/IP Architecture and the TCP/IP Model\n(Parts:\n1\n2\n3\n)\nTCP/IP Protocols\n(Parts:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n)\nOSI Reference Model Layer Summary\n1\nTCP/IP Overview and History\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

      "text_content": "Welcome to The TCP/IP Guide!\nSite design by\nJunefire DTP\nView my photos online!\nOverview\nThe TCP/IP Guide is a reference resource on the TCP/IP \n\tprotocol suite that was designed to be not only comprehensive, but \n\tcomprehensible. Organized using a logical, hierarchical structure, The \n\tTCP/IP Guide uses a personal, easy-going writing style that lets anyone \n\tunderstand the technologies that run the Internet. The Guide explains dozens of protocols \n\tand technologies in over 1,500 pages. It includes full coverage of PPP, ARP, \n\tIP, IPv6, IP NAT, IPSec, Mobile IP, ICMP, RIP, BGP, TCP, UDP, DNS, DHCP, \n\tSNMP, FTP, SMTP, NNTP, HTTP, Telnet and much more.\nThe result of over three years' work by the \n\tauthor of the widely acclaimed electronic resource\nThe PC Guide\n,\nThe TCP/IP Guide breaks new ground in technical \n\teducation, combining understandable text with numerous examples, over 300 \n\tfull-color illustrations, and numerous ease-of-use features. It is distributed in electronic (PDF) \n\tform, resulting in numerous benefits: up-to-date content, lower cost, \n\timmediate availability, thousands of hyperlinks between related topics, and \n\tinstant text search. The TCP Guide is ideal for anyone who wants to\nreally\nunderstand how TCP/IP works, including educators, students, networking \n\tprofessionals, and those working towards certifications.\nThe full TCP/IP Guide is over 1,600 pages \n\tlong and is\navailable to license\nfor a low fee, with \n\tdiscounts for multiple orders. The material is also\navailable online, absolutely free\n. \n\tAnd now, it is also\navailable as a print book\n!\nNews\nSeptember 23, 2017:\nHello\n:\nWow, it has been a while since I updated this! And I know that the material has also gotten rather old at this point.\nI've had a lot of people ask me about updating The TCP/IP Guide, and this is something I've been wanting to do for years.\nUnfortunately, for a variety of reasons, it is unlikely that this will happen.\nThere are a number of reasons for this,\nsome having to do with my personal life and the needs of my family, and some having to do with the marketplace and how\npeople prefer to find and consume information these days. (Hint: It's not in 1,600 page print books.) This isn't ideal \nfor anyone, but unfortunately I have no choice, as it simply isn't practical for me to undertake this sort of project at this\nstage of my life and career. I hope you all understand, and continue to find the existing material useful going forward. \n\t(In truth, while a lot has changed, many of the fundamentals are actually \n\tpretty similar to how they were 15 years ago.)\nEnd of Direct Book Sales:\nIn a related move, I am discontinuing direct sales of the hardcover book. Orders \n\tof the book sent to me directly have dwindled, and \neach one required me to pack and ship the book individually, a time commitment better spent in other areas. I continue\nto sell the\ndownload edition\n, and of course the book can still be purchases at places like\nAmazon\n.\nGeneral Site Updates:\nI've updated \n\tseveral pages on this website to reflect the end of book sales and to \n\tmodernize some of the text (like removing references to 56k modems!)\nDecember 31, 2012:\nHappy New Year and Changes to TCP/IP \n\tElectronic and Book Sales:\nI have made some significant modifications to the front end of the website \n\t(the part you're reading now, that is, not the content) to reflect changes \n\tin how I am selling The TCP/IP Guide going forward. Specifically:\nI am no longer selling The TCP/IP Guide in \n\tCD form. This option was never very popular, and has become even less so as \n\thigh-speed Internet access has become universal. Having the various CD \n\toptions was confusing, and to top it off, I've also run out of the \n\tpressed CDs I ordered years ago, so I've just eliminated this option.\nBook orders now come with an electronic \n\tdownload rather than a CD. You can, of course, burn the information to a CD \n\tif you wish, but most people would rather have the PDF on a hard disk or \n\tflash drive anyway.\nI have moved from processing my own credit \n\tcards to using PayPal. The cost and the security risks associated with \n\thosting my own card processing had become unacceptable, and the use of PayPal is pretty \n\tuniversal at this point. This also opens up additional payment options, such \n\tas paying from a bank account or using a debit card.\nMy warmest wishes to all for a healthy and \n\tprosperous 2013.\nNovember 9, 2012:\nMinor Hacking Incident\n:\nHad a malware issue overnight. Everything has been fixed, but you may see \n\twarnings from Google etc. about this being a \"suspicious site\" until they \n\tcheck the place again and remove it from their list. Sorry for the trouble.\nMay 2, 2011:\nLaunch of the Online Freelancing Guide\n:\nThis isn't directly related to this site, but for those who like my writing, \n\tI'm pleased to announce the release of my new reference resource, the\nOnline Freelancing Guide\n. If \n\tyou're a freelancer, or ever considered becoming one, you'll find a ton of \n\tfantastic information on this site. And like all my sites, it's completely \n\tfree! :)\nJuly 28, 2010:\nBook Shipping Back to Normal:\nI am \n\tnow back to my normal book shipping schedule, and all pending orders \n\treceived during the first three weeks of July have been sent out. Thanks for your \n\tpatience.\nJune 28, 2010:\nTemporary Book Unavailability:\nFor \n\ttechnical reasons, I will be unable to ship books during the first three \n\tweeks of July. Any orders received during this time will be filled in the \n\tfinal week of the month. I apologize for any inconvenience! Note that\nelectronic version\nfulfillment is still \n\timmediate and a better option for those who cannot wait. Thanks for your \n\tunderstanding.\nJune 1, 2010:\nBooks Available and Another Increase:\nI'm pleased to announce that I have finally received shipment of the new \n\tprinting of The TCP/IP Guide book. Pending orders should ship out tomorrow \n\tmorning; thanks for your patience!\nOn the downside, I have been informed that the list price of the book has \n\tgone up by $10 as of this printing. This means that, unfortunately, I have \n\tto raise my prices again -- the timing stinks, since I hadn't raised prices \n\tin four years as of April, and now have had to do so twice within a few \n\tweeks!\nI'm absorbing half of this list price increase, so prices have gone up by \n\t$5, which is only enough to recoup the extra cost to me personally.  \n\tAny existing orders for the old prices will of course be honored. Thanks for \n\tyour understanding.\nApril 30, 2010:\nIt's Been a While!\nGreetings to all of my readers and customers! Sorry that I have taken such a \n\tlong time to update this front page; I always have a lot of things going on, \n\tbut five years is obviously too long to leave a front page sitting. I'll try \n\tto do better in the future.\nI'm pleased to say that The TCP/IP Guide continues to be a leading online \n\treference for TCP/IP material. I am still not away for any resource \n\tcomparable to it on the net.\nThe TCP/IP Guide in book form continues to be fairly popular, though the \n\tbook is now getting a bit older. I am in the early stages of discussion with \n\tmy publisher about a revision to the book, but if this happens, it won't be \n\tready for quite some time. Fortunately, most of what The TCP/IP Guide \n\tcontains is still quite relevant and useful (if I do say so myself!)\nBook Price Increase:\nOne advantage \n\tthat all of you have had due to my not updating this site for several years \n\tis that I also haven't changed my book prices in all of that time. And as we \n\tare all aware, the cost of fuel has increased greatly since 2005, leading to \n\thigher shipping charges as well. I've been absorbing those costs for many \n\tyears now, but am at \n\tthe point where I simply must slightly increase my prices. The cost of \n\tthe downloadable electronic version remains unchanged.\nTemporary Book Unavailability:\nThe \n\tprinter who handles The TCP/IP Guide is currently between printings and the \n\tbook is in short supply. I anticipate that I will be able to resume a full \n\tshipping schedule by the third week of May; any orders received until then \n\twill be held until I have books to send. Thanks for your patience.\n� 2003-2017 Charles M. Kozierok. All Rights Reserved.",

Most of the critical protocols of the suite \r\nfunction at the\nlower \r\nlayers\nof the\nOSI \r\nReference Model\n: layers 2, 3 and 4, which \r\ncorrespond to the network interface, internet and transport layers in \r\nthe\nTCP/IP \r\nmodel architecture\n. Included here are \r\nthe all-important Internet Protocol (IP) at layer 3 and Transmission \r\nControl Protocol (TCP) at layer 4, which combine to give TCP/IP its \r\nname.\nDue to the importance of these and \r\nother TCP/IP protocols at the lower layers, this is the largest chapter \r\nof The TCP/IP Guide. It contains four subsections. The first describes \r\nthe two TCP/IP protocols that reside at the network interface layer, \r\nlayer 2 of the OSI model: PPP and SLIP. The second describes a couple \r\nof “special” protocols that reside architecturally between \r\nlayers 2 and 3: ARP and RARP. The third covers the TCP/IP internet layer \r\n(OSI network layer, layer 3), including IP and several other related \r\nand support protocol. The fourth describes the TCP/IP transport layer \r\nprotocols TCP and UDP.\nBackground Information:\nThe high-level section on the TCP/IP protocol suite\ndescribes it in general terms and lays out its architecture and key protocols.

In the chapter describing the OSI model, \r\nI mentioned that\nits \r\nseven layers could be organized into two layer groupings\n: \r\nthe lower layers (1 through 4) and the upper layers (5 through 7). While \r\nthere are certainly other ways to divide the OSI layers, I feel this \r\nsplit best reflects the different roles that the layers play in a network.\nThe lower layers are concerned primarily \r\nwith the mechanics of formatting, encoding and sending data over a network; \r\nthey involve software elements but are often closely associated with \r\nnetworking hardware devices. In contrast, the upper layers are concerned \r\nmainly with user interaction and the implementation of software applications, \r\nprotocols and services that let us actually make use of the network. \r\nThese elements generally don't need to worry about details, relying \r\non the lower layers to ensure that data gets to where it needs to go \r\nreliably.\nIn this chapter I describe the details \r\nof the many protocols and applications that run on the upper layers \r\nin modern networks and internetworks. The organization of this chapter \r\nis quite different than the previous one. I felt that there was benefit \r\nto explaining the technologies in each of the lower layers separately. \r\nThis is possible because with a few exceptions, the dividing lines between \r\nthe lower layers are fairly well-established, and this helped show how \r\nthe layers differ.\nThe upper layers are much more difficult \r\nto separate from each other, because there are many technologies and \r\napplications that implement more than one of layers 5 through 7. Furthermore, \r\neven differentiating between these layers becomes less important near \r\nthe top of the networking stack. In fact, the TCP/IP protocol suite \r\nuses an architecture that lumps all the higher layers together anyway.\nFor these reasons, this chapter is \r\ndivided functionally and not by layer. It contains four different sections \r\nthat cover distinct higher-layer protocol and application areas. The \r\nfirst discusses naming system, especially the TCP/IP Domain Name System. \r\nThe second overviews file and resource sharing protocols, with a focus \r\non the Network File System. The third covers network configuration and \r\nmanagement protocols, which includes the host configuration protocols \r\nBOOTP and DHCP. The last and largest section covers end-user applications \r\nand application protocols, including general file transfer, electronic \r\nmail, Usenet, the World Wide Web, interactive protocols (such as Telnet) \r\nand administration utilities.\nQuick navigation to\nsubsections\nand\nregular topics\nin this section\nName Systems and TCP/IP Name Registration and Name Resolution\nNetwork File and Resource Sharing Protocols and the TCP/IP Network File System (NFS)\nTCP/IP Network Configuration and Management Protocols (BOOTP, DHCP, SNMP and RMON)\nTCP/IP Key Applications and Application Protocols\nSummary Comparison of TCP/IP Transport Layer Protocols (UDP and TCP)\n1\nName Systems and TCP/IP Name Registration and Name Resolution\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

For this to be possible, it is necessary for everyone \r\nto agree on how layers will be defined and used. The most common tool \r\nfor this purpose is a\nnetworking model\n. The model describes what \r\nthe different layers are in the network, what each is responsible for \r\ndoing, and how they interact. A universally-accepted model ensures that \r\neveryone is on the same page when creating hardware and software.\nThe most common general model in \r\nuse today is the\nOpen Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model\n, \r\nwhich concepts of seven stacked layers. These range from the Physical \r\nLayer (layer one) at the bottom, which is responsible for low-level \r\nsignaling, to the Application Layer (layer seven) at the top, where \r\napplication software is implemented. Understanding the OSI model is \r\nessential to understanding networking as a whole. I explain models and \r\nlayers in more detail, as well as providing a complete description of \r\nthe OSI Reference Model, in\nits \r\nown dedicated section\n.\nNetworking Architectures\nClosely related to the concept of \r\na model is that of an\narchitecture\n. An architecture is essentially \r\na set of rules that describes the function of some portion of the hardware \r\nand software that constitute a stack of layers. Such a rule-set usually \r\ntakes the form of a specification or standard that describes how equipment \r\nand programs using the technology must behave. A networking architecture \r\nis designed to implement the functions associated with a particular \r\ncontiguous set of layers of the OSI Reference Model, either formally \r\nor informally.\nIn this Guide we are, of course, \r\ninterested in the TCP/IP protocol suite, which runs the Internet, and \r\na complex set of technologies that spans many layers of the OSI model. \r\nIt is by examining the various components of TCP/IP and how they implement \r\ndifferent OSI model layers that we will really learn how TCP/IP works. \r\nFor starters, the name of the suite, TCP/IP, comes from the Transmission \r\nControl Protocol (TCP), which operates at layer four of the OSI model, \r\nand the Internet Protocol (IP) that runs at OSI model layer three. IP \r\nprovides services to layer four and uses services of layer two below \r\nit. TCP uses IP's functions and provides functions to the layers above \r\nit. The complete examination of TCP/IP starts by looking at\nits \r\narchitecture and a second, special model\nthat \r\nwas developed specifically to make sense of TCP/IP.\nFundamental Network Characteristics\n1\n2\nProtocols: What Are They, Anyway?\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

Since it lets network \r\nadministrators assign IP addresses to hosts based on how they are connected \r\nin physical networks, subnetting is a real breakthrough for those maintaining \r\nlarge IP networks. It has its own weaknesses though, and still has room \r\nfor improvement. The main weakness of conventional subnetting is in \r\nfact that the subnet ID represents only\none\nadditional hierarchical \r\nlevel in how IP addresses are interpreted and used for routing.\nThe Problem With Single-Level Subnetting\nIt may seem “greedy” to \r\nlook at subnetting and say “what, only\none\nadditional level”?\nJ\nHowever, in \r\nlarge networks, the need to divide our entire network into only one \r\nlevel of subnetworks doesn't represent the best use of our IP address \r\nblock. Furthermore, we have already seen that since the subnet ID is \r\nthe same length throughout the network, we can have problems if we have \r\nsubnetworks with very different numbers of hosts on them—the subnet \r\nID must be chosen based on whichever subnet has the greatest number \r\nof hosts, even if most of subnets have far fewer. This is inefficient \r\neven in small networks, and can result in the need to use extra addressing \r\nblocks while wasting many of the addresses in each block.\nFor example, consider a relatively \r\nsmall company with a Class C network, 201.45.222.0/24. They have six \r\nsubnetworks in their network. The first four subnets (\nS1\n,\nS2\n,\nS3\nand\nS4\n) are relatively small, containing only 10 hosts \r\neach. However, one of them (\nS5\n) is for their production floor \r\nand has 50 hosts, and the last (\nS6\n) is their development and \r\nengineering group, which has 100 hosts.\nThe total number of hosts needed \r\nis thus 196. Without subnetting, we have enough hosts in our Class C \r\nnetwork to handle them all. However, when we try to subnet, we have \r\na big problem. In order to have six subnets we need to use 3 bits for \r\nthe subnet ID. This leaves only 5 bits for the host ID, which means \r\nevery subnet has the identical capacity of 30 hosts, as shown in\nFigure 70\n. \r\nThis is enough for the smaller subnets but not enough for the larger \r\nones. The only solution with conventional subnetting, other than shuffling \r\nthe physical subnets, is to get another Class C block for the two big \r\nsubnets and use the original for the four small ones. But this is expensive, \r\nand means wasting hundreds of IP addresses!\nFigure 70: Class C (/24) Network Split Into Eight Conventional Subnets\nWith traditional subnetting, all subnets must be the same size, which creates problems when there are some subnets that are much larger than others.

We start by associating a subnet base \r\naddress with each physical network (since at least in theory, our subnets \r\ncorrespond to our physical networks). We then sequentially assign hosts \r\nparticular IP addresses within the subnet (or in a different manner, \r\nif we prefer!)\nDetermining host addresses is really \r\nquite simple, once we know the subnet address. All we do is substitute \r\nthe numbers 1, 2, 3… and so on for the host ID bits in the subnet \r\naddress. We must do this in binary of course, and then convert the address \r\nto decimal form. Again, we can do some “short-cutting” once \r\nthe rather obvious pattern of how to assign addresses emerges. We'll \r\nlook at those later in the topic.\nClass C Host Address Determination Example\nLet's start with our Class C example \r\nagain, 211.77.20.0, which we divided into 8 subnets using 3 subnet bits. \r\nHere's how the address appears with the subnet bits shown highlighted, \r\nand the host ID bits shown highlighted and underlined.:\n11010011 01001101 00010100\n000\n00000\nThe first subnet is subnet #0, which \r\nhas all zeroes for those subnet bits, and thus the same address as the \r\nnetwork as a whole: 211.77.20.0. We substitute the numbers 1, 2, 3 and \r\nso on for the underlined bits to get the host IDs. (Remember that we \r\ndon't start with 0 here because for the host ID, the all-zero and all-one \r\nbinary patterns have special meaning). So it goes like this:\nThe first host address has the number \r\n1 for the host ID, or “00001” in binary. So, it is:\n11010011 01001101 00010100\n000\n00001\nIn decimal, this is 211.77.20.1.\nThe second host address has the number \r\n2 for the host ID, or “00010” in binary. Its binary value \r\nis:\n11010011 01001101 00010100\n000\n00010\nIn decimal, this is 211.77.20.2\nI'm sure you get the picture already; \r\nthe third host will be 211.77.20.3, the fourth 211.77.20.4 and so on. \r\nThere is a maximum of 30 hosts in each subnet, as we saw before. So, \r\nthe last host in this subnet will be found by substituting 30 (11110 \r\nin binary) for the host ID bits, resulting in a decimal address of 211.77.20.30.\nWe can do the same thing for each \r\nof the other subnets; the only thing that changes is the values in the \r\nsubnet ID bits. Let's take for example, subnet #6. It has “110” \r\nfor the subnet bits instead of “000”. So, its subnet base \r\naddress is 211.77.20.192, or:\n11010011 01001101 00010100\n110\n00000\nWe assign hosts to this subnet by \r\nsubstituting 00001, then 00010, then 00011 for the host ID bits as before:\nThe first host address is:\n11010011 01001101 00010100\n110\n00001\nOr 211.77.20.193.\nThe second host address is:\n11010011 01001101 00010100\n110\n00010\nOr 211.77.20.194.\nAnd so on, all the way up to the \r\nlast host in the subnet, which is 211.77.20.222.\nFigure 80\nshows graphically how subnet and host addresses are calculated for this \r\nsample network.\nFigure 80: Determining Host Addresses For A Class C Network\nThis diagram shows how both subnet addresses and host addresses are determined in a two-step process. The subnet addresses are found by substituting subnet ID values (shown in red) for the subnet ID bits of the network. Then, for any given subnet address, we can determine a host address by substituting a host number (shown in blue) for the host ID bits within that subnet. So, for example, host #2 in subnet #6 has “110” for the subnet ID and “00010” for the host ID, resulting in a final octet value of “11000010” or 194.\nOne more address we may \r\nwish to calculate is the broadcast address for the subnet. This of course \r\nis one of the\nspecial \r\ncases\n, found by substituting all ones \r\nfor the host ID. For subnet #0, this would be 211.77.20.31. For subnet \r\n#6, it would be 211.77.20.223. That's pretty much all there is to it.\nIP Subnetting Step #4: Determining Subnet Identifiers and Subnet Addresses\n1\n2\n3\nIP Classless Addressing: Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) / \"Supernetting\"\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

A special DNS question type, called\nAXFR\n(\naddress transfer\n) is used to initiate the zone transfer. \r\nThe server will then transfer the resource records for the zone using \r\na series of DNS response messages (assuming that the server that requested \r\nthe transfer is authorized to do so). Since it's important that zone \r\ntransfers be received reliably, and since the amount of data to be sent \r\nis large and needs to be managed, a TCP session must first be established \r\nand used for zone transfers. This is in contrast to the simpler UDP \r\ntransport used for regular DNS messages. This is discussed in\nthe \r\ntopic discussing the use of UDP and TCP for DNS\n.\nOnce the zone transfer is complete, \r\nthe slave name server will update its database and return to regular \r\noperation. It will continue to perform regular polls of the master server \r\nevery\nRefresh\nseconds. If it has a problem with a regular poll, \r\nit will try again after\nRetry\nseconds. Finally, if an amount \r\nof time equal to\nExpires\nseconds elapses, the master name server \r\nwill stop serving data from the zone until it re-establishes contact \r\nwith the primary name server.\nKey Concept:\nSlave name servers do not have their DNS information managed directly by an administrator. Instead, they obtain information from their master name server on a periodic basis through a process called a\nzone transfer\n. Several fields in the\nStart Of Authority\nDNS resource record control the zone transfer process, including specifying how often transfers are done and how slave name servers handle problem conditions such as an inability to contact the master server.\nNote that the DNS\nNotify\nfeature \r\nis an enhancement to the basic zone status check / zone transfer model. \r\nIt allows the master server to notify a slave server when the master’s \r\ndatabase has changed. Another new feature allows only part of a zone \r\nto be transferred instead of the entire zone.\nSee \r\nthe topic on DNS name server enhancements for more\n.\nDNS Name Server Types and Roles: Primary/Master, Secondary/Slave and Caching-Only Servers\n1\n2\n3\nDNS Root Name Servers\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

The vendor \r\nextensions introduced in RFC 1048 were popular, and over the years, \r\nadditional vendor extensions were defined; RFC 1048 was replaced by \r\nRFCs 1084, 1395 and 1497 in succession. Some confusion also resulted \r\nover the years in how some sections of RFC 951 should be interpreted, \r\nand how certain features of BOOTP work.\nRFC 1542,\nClarifications and \r\nExtensions for the Bootstrap Protocol\n, was published in October \r\n1993 to address this, and also made some slight changes to the protocol's \r\noperation. (RFC 1542 is actually a correction of the nearly-identical \r\nRFC 1532 that had some small errors in it.)\nWhile BOOTP was obviously quite successful, \r\nit also had certain weaknesses of its own. One of the most important \r\nof these is lack of support for\ndynamic\naddress assignment. The \r\nneed for dynamic assignment became much more pronounced when the Internet \r\nreally started to take off in the late 90s. This led directly to the \r\ndevelopment of the\nDynamic \r\nHost Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\n.\nWhile DHCP replaced BOOTP as the \r\nTCP/IP host configuration protocol of choice, it would be inaccurate \r\nto say that BOOTP is “gone”. It is still used to this day \r\nin various networks. Furthermore, DHCP was based directly on BOOTP, \r\nand they share many attributes, including a common message format. BOOTP \r\nvendor extensions were used as the basis for DHCP\noptions\n, which \r\nwork in the same way but include extra capabilities. In fact, the successor \r\nto RFC 1497 is RFC 1533, which officially merges BOOTP vendor extensions \r\nand BOOTP options into the same standard.\nTCP/IP Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)\n1\n2\n3\nBOOTP Client/Server Messaging and Addressing\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

BOOTP, like a number of other request/reply protocols, \r\nuses a common message format for requests and replies. The client starts \r\nby setting aside memory space for the message and clearing it to all \r\nzeroes. It then fills in the fields of the message and sends the request, \r\nas we saw in\nthe \r\nprevious topic\n. The server creates its \r\nreply not from scratch, but by copying the request and changing certain \r\nfields.\nBOOTP messages contain a considerable \r\nnumber of fields, so the message format is rather large. It is described \r\nfully in\nTable 186\nand illustrated in\nFigure 256\n.\nTable 186: BOOTP Message Format\nField \r\nName\nSize (bytes)\nDescription\nOp\n1\nOperation Code:\nSpecifies the type of message. A value of 1 indicates a request (\nBOOTREQUEST\nmessage) while a value of 2 is a reply (\nBOOTREPLY\nmessage).\nHType\n1\nHLen\n1\nHardware Address Length:\nSpecifies how long hardware addresses are in this message. For Ethernet \r\nor other networks using IEEE 802 MAC addresses, the value is 6. This \r\ntoo is the same as the field with a similar name (\nHLN\n) in the\nARP field \r\nformat\n.\nHops\n1\nHops:\nSet to 0 by a client before transmitting a request and used by\nBOOTP \r\nrelay agents\nto control the forwarding \r\nof BOOTP messages.\nXID\n4\nTransaction Identifier:\nA 32-bit identification field generated by the client, to allow it to \r\nmatch up the request with replies received from BOOTP servers.\nSecs\n2\nSeconds:\nAccording to RFC 951, the client enters into this field the number of \r\nseconds “elapsed since [the] client started trying to boot”. \r\nThis is supposed to provide information to BOOTP servers to help them \r\ndecide which requests to respond to first.\nUnfortunately, this definition was somewhat vague; it wasn't clear if \r\nthis meant the amount of time since the machine was powered on, or since \r\nthe first\nBOOTREQUEST\nmessage was sent. In addition, some devices \r\nincorrectly implemented this field. As a result, it is not always used.\nFlags\n2\nCIAddr\n4\nClient \r\nIP Address:\nIf the client has a current IP address that it plans \r\nto keep using, it puts it in this field. By filling in this field, the \r\nclient is committing to responding to unicast IP datagrams sent to this \r\naddress. Otherwise, it sets this field to all zero to tell the server \r\nit wants an address assigned.\nSee \r\nthe end of the detailed operation topic for important information on \r\nthis field\n.\nYIAddr\n4\n“Your” IP Address:\nThe IP address that the server is assigning to the client. This may \r\nbe different than the IP address currently used by the client.\nSee \r\nthe topic describing BOOTP operation in detail for an explanation of \r\nwhat happens in that case\n.\nSIAddr\n4\nServer \r\nIP Address:\nThe IP address of the BOOTP server sending a\nBOOTREPLY\nmessage.\nGIAddr\n4\nGateway IP Address:\nThis field is used to route BOOTP messages when\nBOOTP \r\nrelay agents\nfacilitate the communication \r\nof BOOTP requests and replies between a client and a server on different \r\nsubnets or networks. To understand the name, remember that the old TCP/IP \r\nterm for “router” is “gateway”; BOOTP relay agents \r\nare typically routers.\nNote that this field is set to 0 by the client and should be ignored \r\nby the client when processing a\nBOOTREPLY\n. It specifically does\nnot\nrepresent the server giving the client the address \r\nof a default router address to be used for general IP routing purposes.\nCHAddr\n16\nClient \r\nHardware Address:\nThe hardware (layer two) address of the client \r\nsending a\nBOOTREPLY\n. It is used both to look up a device's assigned \r\nIP address and also possibly in delivery of a reply message.\nSName\n64\nServer Name:\nThe \r\nserver sending a\nBOOTREPLY\nmay optionally put its name in this \r\nfield. This can be a simple text “nickname” or a\nfully-qualified \r\nDNS domain name\n(such as “myserver.organization.org”).\nNote that a client may specify a name in this field when it creates \r\nits request. If it does so, it is saying that it wants to get a reply \r\nonly from the BOOTP server with this name. This may be done to ensure \r\nthat the client is able to access a particular boot file stored on only \r\none server\nFile\n128\nBoot \r\nFilename:\nContains the full directory path and file name of \r\na boot file that can be downloaded by the client to complete its bootstrapping \r\nprocess. The client may request a particular type of file by entering \r\na text description here, or may leave the field blank and the server \r\nwill supply the filename of the default file.\nVend\n64\nVendor-Specific Area:\nOriginally created to allow vendors to customize BOOTP to the needs \r\nof different types of hardware, this field is now also used to hold \r\nadditional vendor-independent configuration information.\nSee \r\nthe next topic, on BOOTP vendor information extensions\n. \r\nIt may be used by the client and/or the server.\nFigure 256: BOOTP Message Format\nAs I mentioned in\nthe \r\ntopic on BOOTP messaging\n, both requests \r\nand replies are encapsulated into UDP messages for transmission. The \r\nBOOTP standard specifies that the use of UDP checksums is optional. \r\nUsing the checksum provides protection against data integrity errors \r\nand is thus recommended. This may cause unacceptable processing demands \r\non the part of very simple clients, so the checksum can legally be skipped.\nSimilarly, for simplicity, BOOTP \r\nassumes that its messages will not be\nfragmented\n. \r\nThis is to allow BOOTP clients to avoid the complexity of reassembling \r\nfragmented messages. Since BOOTP messages are only 300 bytes in length, \r\nunder the minimum MTU required for all TCP/IP links, this is not normally \r\nan issue.\nBOOTP Detailed Operation\n1\nBOOTP Vendor-Specific Area and Vendor Information Extensions\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.

Certain characters in the set are called\nunsafe\n, \r\nbecause they have special meaning in different contexts, and including \r\nthem in a URL would lead to ambiguity or problems in of how they should \r\nbe interpreted. The “space” character is the classical “unsafe” \r\ncharacter because spaces are normally used to separate URLs, so including \r\none in a URL would break the URL into “pieces”. Other characters \r\nare “unsafe” because they have special significance in a URL, \r\nsuch as the colon (“:”).\nThe “safe” characters in \r\na URL are alphanumerics (A to Z, a to z and 0 to 9) and the following \r\nspecial characters: the dollar sign (“$”), hyphen (“-”), \r\nunderscore (“_”), period (“.”), plus sign (“+”), \r\nexclamation point (“!”), asterisk (“*”), apostrophe \r\n(“'”), left parenthesis (“(”), and right parenthesis \r\n(“)”). All other “unsafe” characters can be represented \r\nin a URL using an encoding scheme consisting of a percent sign (“%”) \r\nfollowed by the hexadecimal ASCII value of the character. The most common \r\nexamples are given in\nTable 223\n.\nTable 223: URL Special Character Encodings\nCharacter\nEncoding\nCharacter\nEncoding\nCharacter\nEncoding\n<space>\n%20\n<\n%3C\n>\n%3E\n#\n%23\n%\n%25\n{\n%7B\n}\n%7D\n|\n%7C\n\\\n%5C\n^\n%5E\n~\n%7E\n[\n%5B\n]\n%5D\n`%60\n;\n%3B\n/\n%2F\n?\n%3F\n:\n%3A\n@\n%40\n=\n%3D\n%\n%26\nWhen these sequences are \r\nencountered, they are interpreted as the literal character they represent, \r\nwithout any “significance”. So, the URL “http://www.myfavesite.com/are%20you%20there%3F” \r\npoints to a file called “are you there?” on “www.myfavesite.com”. \r\nThe “%20” codes prevent the spaces from breaking up the URL, \r\nand the “3F” prevents the question mark in the file name from \r\nbeing interpreted as a special URL character.\nNote:\nSince the percent sign is used for this encoding mechanism, it itself is “special”; any time it is seen the next values are interpreted as character encodings, so to embed a literal percent sign, it must be encoded as “%25”.\nAgain, these encodings are sometimes \r\nabused for nefarious purposes, unfortunately, such as using them for \r\nregular ASCII characters to\nobscure \r\nURLs\n.\nUniform Resource Locators (URLs)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nURL Schemes (Applications / Access Methods) and Scheme-Specific Syntaxes\nIf you find The TCP/IP Guide useful, please consider making a small Paypal donation to help the site, using one of the buttons below.
