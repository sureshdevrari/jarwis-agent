# Session 2026-01-03 - Mobile Penetration Testing Implementation

## User Request

**Date:** January 3, 2026

### Primary Request

> "implement full flash android and ios app testing, so if the application is ssl pinned, first frida will bypass ssl pinning then we have to use android emulator to run the app to intercept the request in burp style, then we have to do the same thing we have done for web application test like crawling and everything"

### Requirements Breakdown

1. **Full Android and iOS App Testing**
   - Support both APK (Android) and IPA (iOS) files
   - Complete penetration testing workflow

2. **SSL Pinning Bypass via Frida**
   - Bypass SSL pinning first before any traffic interception
   - Support multiple HTTP libraries (OkHttp, Retrofit, Volley, AFNetworking, Alamofire, etc.)
   - Flutter app support

3. **Android Emulator Integration**
   - Use Android emulator to run apps
   - Automatic emulator setup and management
   - Frida server installation on emulator

4. **Burp-Style Traffic Interception**
   - Intercept all HTTP/HTTPS requests like Burp Suite
   - Full request/response capture
   - Export to HAR, Burp XML, JSON formats
   - Sensitive data detection

5. **Web-Like Testing Workflow**
   - Crawling and endpoint discovery (same as web testing)
   - Pre-authentication attacks
   - Authentication handling (OTP, password, OAuth)
   - Post-authentication attacks
   - AI-powered analysis
   - Report generation

## Implementation Completed

### New Files Created

1. `attacks/mobile/frida_ssl_bypass.py` - Frida-based SSL pinning bypass
2. `attacks/mobile/ios_simulator_manager.py` - iOS Simulator management
3. `attacks/mobile/mobile_orchestrator.py` - Unified 9-phase mobile pentest orchestrator
4. `attacks/mobile/burp_interceptor.py` - Burp-style traffic interceptor
5. `run_mobile_scan.py` - CLI runner for mobile penetration testing

### API Endpoints Added

- `POST /api/scan/mobile/full` - Start full mobile pentest
- `GET /api/scan/mobile/full/<scan_id>/status` - Get scan status
- `GET /api/scan/mobile/full/<scan_id>/result` - Get results
- `GET /api/scan/mobile/full/<scan_id>/logs` - Get logs
- `POST /api/scan/mobile/full/<scan_id>/stop` - Stop scan
- `GET /api/scan/mobile/full/list` - List all scans
- `GET /api/scan/mobile/full/<scan_id>/traffic` - Get intercepted traffic

### Updated Files

- `attacks/mobile/__init__.py` - Added exports for new modules
- `api/app.py` - Added full mobile scan endpoints
